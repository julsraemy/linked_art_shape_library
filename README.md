# Linked Art Shape Library
Shape library of [Linked Art](https://linked.art/) classes and properties to be used with draw.io/diagrams.net. The classes and properties are derived from https://linked.art/ns/terms/ and can be used in conjunction with some of the [shape libraries](https://github.com/chin-rcip/diagrams.net_libraries) (especially CIDOC-CRM, CRMdig and CRMgeo) of the Canadian Heritage Information Network. 

Please note that Linked Art V1.0 has not yet been published - which means that amendments may be necessary.
