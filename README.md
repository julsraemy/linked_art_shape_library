# Linked Art Shape Library
Shape library of [Linked Art](https://linked.art/) classes and properties to be used with draw.io/diagrams.net. The classes and properties are derived from https://linked.art/ns/terms/relates_to.xml and can be used in conjunction with some of the [shape libraries](https://github.com/chin-rcip/diagrams.net_libraries) (especially CIDOC-CRM, CRMdig and CRMgeo) of the Canadian Heritage Information Network. 

Usage
Either download the XML from this repository and import it on Diagrams.net (_File_ > _Open Library From_ > _Device ..._) or add it directily via the URI (_File_ > _Open Library From_ > _URL ..._). Once added, the shapes will appear on the left-hand side of the application.
